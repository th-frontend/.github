## Hi there 👋

Welcome,we have a little bit of a new look. 

[Components](https://github.com/th-frontend/components) - Is going to be the spot to stash any code if you want to contribute but you are unsure. Just add an [issue](https://github.com/th-frontend/components/issues) 


[Notes/Tutorials](https://github.com/th-frontend/notes-tutorials) - This is going to be your spot for helpful documents that don't fit inside of the components. Things like how to setup a Google Anaytics 4. Feel free to add anything but if you are unsure just add an [issue](https://github.com/th-frontend/components/issues)


🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)


<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
